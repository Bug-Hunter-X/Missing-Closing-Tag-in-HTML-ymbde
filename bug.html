<p>This is a common error, but it can be easily missed:</p><code><div> <p>This is some text within a div element.</p> </div> <p>This is some more text.</p></code><p>The problem is that the closing tag of the div is missing. This means the browser will not be able to render the page correctly and may throw errors. To fix this, simply add the closing tag:</p><code><div> <p>This is some text within a div element.</p> </div> <p>This is some more text.</p></code>
